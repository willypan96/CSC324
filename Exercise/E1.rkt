#| CSC324 2017 Winter. Exercise 1.

 1. Change the implementation of ‘fix-1st’ below to not name the returned function, but
     instead make an anonymous function.

 2. Read the summary of mapping and applying below.

 3. Complete the ‘check-expect’s below, and the functions ‘columns→database’ and ‘π’.
    Do not use recursion. 
    Add at least two partial design ‘check-expect’s for ‘π’ after the last one,
     showing the process of generalization that ‘check-expect’. |#
